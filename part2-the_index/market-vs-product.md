# Market vs. Product

Do we need to learn about the _market_ or the _product_?

To narrow down the large list of methods to something actionable, we can first separate our questions into those about the market and those about the product.

## Market

* Who is our customer?

* What are their pains?

* What job needs to be done?

* How are they doing this job today?

* Does the customer segment already have a solution to this pain?

* Is this customer segment really willing to pay for a better solution for this job?

* Is our customer segment too broad?

* How do we find them?

* How much will this customer segment pay?

* How do we convince this customer segment to buy?

* What is the cost to acquire a customer in this customer segment?

## Product

* How can we solve this problem?

* What form should this take?

* How important is the design?

* What’s the quickest solution?

* What is the minimum feature set?

* How should we prioritize?

* Is this solution working?

* Are people using it?

* Which solution is better?

* How should we optimize this?

* What do people like / dislike?

* Why do they do that?

* Why do prospects buy from us?

* Why do prospects not buy from us?

In this case, “market” refers to any question or element that is mostly or completely connected to the identity of the customer segment.

For example, market questions include those about which channels we can use to reach the customers. We cannot use traditional broadcast television advertising to target customers who don’t have a television set.

“Product” \(or service\) is simplified to mean anything regarding the value proposition or the production of it. This includes resources needed to produce the value proposition, as well as any key activities, partners, or costs.

The value proposition really sits at the intersection of the market needs and the product itself. The product has no value outside of the customer using it, but in this case, we are again simplifying for navigation.

_If we are using the Business Model Canvas, market questions are those on the right side of the canvas, including: customer, channel, relationship, and revenue. Product questions are those about the value proposition and everything left of it including: key activities, key resources, key partners, and costs._

## Where Should We Start?

This book is agnostic about where we start. We may already have a product and are investigating who to sell it to or we may have a customer segment with a strong pain point and are trying to find a solution. However, when in doubt, start with the customer.

If the customer segment changes, then the product usually must be adapted to the customer. However, if the product changes, customers may simply use a different product. Human behavior is notoriously difficult to change, although it is not impossible.
