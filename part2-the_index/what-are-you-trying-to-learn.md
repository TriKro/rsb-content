# What Are You Trying to Learn

**“If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” - Albert Einstein**

In school, we’re constantly taking tests to gauge how well we’ve learned last week’s material. We cram geographic boundaries, the dates of battles, and multiplication tables into our heads and spit out the results.

Sadly, those rote memorization skills and the ability to answer pre-formulated questions doesn’t help us as entrepreneurs. When building a new business model, there is no test or quiz that we can cram for. It’s as if we sat down for our final and opened up the exam book only to find a blank piece of paper in front of us.

“Where is the test?” we ask.

“Right there in front of you,” answers our teacher.

“Is there a right answer?” we hesitantly inquire.

“Yes there is,” assures our teacher.

“What are the questions?” we plead.

“That’s what you have to figure out.”

As an entrepreneur \(or intrapreneur\), we can’t just guess at the answers without first identifying the right questions to ask. If we just guess by building a fully functioning product, it’s very likely that the market will judge us wrong and punish us with zero sales and bankruptcy.

Our job, as an entrepreneur, is to first ask the right questions, and only then can we find the right answers.

## What Are Good Questions?

The questions we must answer are fundamental gaps in our business model. Questions like:

* Who is our customer?

* What job do they want done?

* What channels can we use to reach them?

* Which features should we build for our first product?

* Is our solution good enough?

If we can identify the right question, there is a corresponding method or methods listed in this book to help answer that question.

If we attempt to execute a method in this book without first identifying the right question to ask, the results of that experiment are typically very difficult if not impossible to interpret correctly.

For example, let’s say we’re selling a new type of shoe that cures plantar fasciitis. We put up a landing page test \(a type of smoke test\) with our value proposition and a “buy now” button. Then we put $1000 in to Google Adwords for “shoes” to drive traffic and sit back to wait for the money to start rolling in…

…and our conversion rate is 0%

Should we give up? That’s what the landing page test says. There is insufficient demand for this product.

“But what is plantar fasciitis???”

Exactly. All those people coming to our site are asking the same thing.

Is our test failing because customers aren’t interested, or does it fail because our customers simply can’t understand the value proposition? Or are we just focused on the wrong channel?

In this case, we were asking “Does anyone want my product?” when we should be asking “Does our customer understand what plantar fasciitis is?” or even “Who is our customer?”

## **How Do We Ask the Right Questions?**

We know that asking the right questions is important, but _actually_ figuring out those questions can often be a challenge. How do we know we’re not missing anything? How do we know we are asking the most important questions?

It’s impossible to see our own blind spots. That’s the definition of a blind spot.

Unfortunately, it’s these blind spots that often hold the deadliest questions and business risks.

One way to generate these questions is brainstorming around your problems/challenges/opportunities and reframing them as questions. There are many ways to brainstorm questions and identify gaps in our business model such as using the Business Model Canvas, but most of them still leave blind spots. Fortunately, it’s quite easy for other people who have a little emotional distance from our business to see where we are making risky assumptions. So instead of listing a variety of brainstorming methods, the only advice we’ll offer in this book is just to ask someone else.

A _peer review_ is a time honored method to eliminate oversights. It can be used to proofread a document or just to make sure we’re not about to walk out of the house with mismatching socks.

To peer review our business model, we don’t even need to ask a seasoned entrepreneur or industry expert. Almost anyone is able to provide the input we need.

We can present our business idea and business model to someone else and ask _them_ to ask _us_ questions. Encourage them to ask any question they want and make sure to mention that there are no dumb questions.

We simply to write down those questions. They may be questions that we have failed to ask ourselves. If we do four or five peer reviews and everyone asks us, “Who is your target customer?” or “Gee….your target customer seems very broad” we probably haven’t defined our target customer very well.

We should not defend our idea or try and explain in excruciating detail why their question is **not** a risk for us. Our job is only to note the questions that are being asked and include them when we prioritize.

## Priority Does Not Have a Plural

We will certainly have more than one question once we’re finished brainstorming and doing peer reviews. We should have at least 10 and probably more like 20. If you have less than 10, you are probably missing questions in your blind spots.

Startups are risky. There are a lot of unknowns and a lot of open questions. If we can only see five or six questions, it does not mean our startup is _less_ risky than someone with 20 questions. It actually means our startup is _more_ risky because we are not acknowledging and therefore not dealing those unknowns.

However, we can only address one question at a time effectively. So we have to prioritize.

Again, there are many methods for prioritizing and we won’t list them all here. We should just pick one question where the answer could potentially destroy our entire business model.

We may chose the wrong question to start. That’s ok.

It is better to pick the wrong question and answer it quickly than spend days, weeks, or months agonizing over multiple priorities to develop a perfect plan or action for the next year. Just pick one, and get going.

The following sections will show you how to take that one priority question and figure out how to answer it with Research or an Experiment.

## Locate The Question

To simplify our search for the right method, we’ll ask two questions:

1. Do we need to learn about the _market_ or the _product_?

2. Do we have a falsifiable hypothesis to _evaluate_ or do we need to _generate_ a clear idea?

Mapping the intersection of these two questions gives us a 2x2 matrix:

Based on this, if we have a clear hypothesis of who our customer is and what we think they will pay for, we can conduct an _Evaluative Market Experiment_ such as a smoke test.

If we don’t have a clear idea of who our customer is, we can do _Generative Market Research_ like data mining.

Similarly, if we have a clear hypothesis of which features will solve the customer’s problems, we can do an _Evaluative Product Experiment_ such as _Wizard of Oz_ testing. If we do not know which features will lead to an acceptable solution, we can do _Generative Product Research_ such as a _Concierge Product_ to try and come up with new ideas.

**Any framework is an oversimplification of reality! This Index is a quick way to navigate to the correct method, but doesn’t mean you don’t need to think.**

The _Index of Questions_ and the _Index of Methods_ show the complete list of questions and their corresponding methods. But first we’ll look at the details of Market vs. Product and Generative vs. Evaluative.
