# Concierge Test

## In Brief
Concierge is a technique to test the solution of a customer problem by manually performing tasks as a service. It is typically not very cost effective but can provide detailed information about how a solution can be created and what minimum viable feature set should be included in an automated and optimized product.

## Helps Answer
- Does the solution solve a real customer problem?
- How can the problem be solved?
- What is the minimum feature set required to implement a solution?
- What are the greatest problems in effecting a solution for the customer?

## Description
In a concierge test the value proposition is delivered as a service. Like a hotel concierge the focus is on a highly customized customer facing service. For this method you need to perform the tasks manually, usually with a few customers as it is not cost efficient to scale. However the high customer touch allows you to get quality feedback from the targeted segment. Key advantage is that services can be almost instantly adjusted at a very low cost. Hence iterations based on insights from customer feedback are easily done. 

To conduct a successful concierge test you need to be clear about your value proposition and have it well formulated. As as an evolution of problem-solution interview techniques the goal is to test the solution and figure out if it matches your customer’s expectations. Design your value proposition as a service with the leap-of-faith assumptions in mind. When using the service your customers should go through the same steps as they would go through later with your product idea.

Deliver your service manually in a customized and personal way. This requires you to start with just a small batch of customers to avoid being overwhelmed. At this point you do not need a single line of code or automation. Even though it is not efficient and time consuming keep in mind that the direct customer touch you can learn from is more valuable. While delivering your service keep collecting feedback from your customers and adjust your service accordingly. 

After some time you learn what your exact customers expectations are and what is really valuable to them. Gradually automate the parts of your service that work. Be careful not to run your concierge test forever! Keep automating and expanding your service until you are not getting any new major insights.

### Time Commitment & Resources
Concierge tests can be the most time consuming test to perform as it requires manually solving the customer problem. For a complex B2B IT solution, a concierge solution can be a complete consulting engagement lasting many months. For a consumer, it might be as simple as personally going shopping with a customer.

Similarly, resources can be extremely intense, or as little as a pen and paper. In the case of a B2B concierge service, it is often possible to charge for the solution up front which eliminates any resource constraints.

### How To
- Write down the value proposition that needs to be tested. 
- Design the value proposition as a personalized, customer touching service.
- Talk to potential customers (early adopters) and offer them your service in exchange for a payment.
- Execute the service by performing tasks manually even though it is not effective.

### Interpreting Results
The data you collect will be mainly qualitative data as you are delivering a manual service. You need to aggregate the data from all your current customers for the various aspects of your service. Use the insights to adjust your service accordingly.

The main benefit of this method is to generate idea around the potential solution/product and identify any obstacles to implementing that solution. 

### Potential Biases
- False Positive Bias: This method does not serve to validate the solution as the manual component provides an extra value proposition of trust and responsiveness. Entrepreneurs can therefore mistake positive feedback on the service as validation of the product concept. When moving to an automated solution, the extra “human” value proposition is removed and the customer can reject the solution.
- Sampling Bias: As the concierge test is manually performed you have to find a balance. On the one hand having too much customers leads you to be overwhelmed. You find yourself or your team just busy to deliver the promised service. Which leaves very little time to analyze the data and using the insights to adjust. On the other hand you have to make sure that your customer batch is not too small. Insights you get from e.g. just one or two customers might not be enough. You risk that the collected feedback is not representative for your customer segment you are targeting.
