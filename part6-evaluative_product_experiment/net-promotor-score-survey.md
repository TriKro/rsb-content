# Net Promotor Score Survey

## In Brief
Net Promoter Score identifies customer loyalty to the brand or product. The survey uses a score of 0 to 10 to the answer to the question: “How likely is it that you would recommend [company X or product Y] to a friend or colleague?”.

Net Promoter Score was first introduced by Frederick F. Reichheld in a Harvard Business Review article: “The One Number You Need to Grow”. 

From the score of 0 to 10, people who give score 9 to 10 are considered “Promoters.” People who give score 7 to 8 are considered “Passives,” meaning who are satisfied but are not very loyal to your brand or product. People who give score 0 to 6 are considered “Detractors.” 

The Net Promoter Score question can be followed up with another question to find out the reason(s) for the score the customer gave. By doing so, the Net Promoter Score can be associated with both qualitative and quantitative results.

## Description
Net Promoter Score tracks loyalty and can identify the ambassadors amongst your customers. It is commonly used as a simple customer satisfaction metric.

The Net Promoter Score is not just one question but rather, a group of questions probing to understand the customer’s feeling or loyalty towards the company, product, or service. 

By understanding the reasons of the scores, you can determine how many people will become ambassadors. It can also determine where your company, product, or service stands in word of mouth marketing.

### Time Commitment and Resources
The survey can be sent to customers at one time. The results can be compiled and analyzed in about a week. NPS surveys can be sent every six months or every year to determine changes as well.

### How To
NPS survey is simple and straightforward. You can use third party survey company/services like Survey Monkey or traditional pen-and-paper methods. You can even just send the question via email to your customers directly. 

Many companies send NPS question together with other survey questions to save time and resources. 

### Interpreting Results
By understanding the reasons why the customers are loyal to (or recommend) your company, product, service, loyalty economics can be calculated. 

While there are some variances on the interpretations of an NPS result, the original NPS score calculation is achieved by subtracting the percentage of respondents that are labeled “Detractors” from the percentage of respondents that are labeled “Promoters” like this: 

NPS = % of Promoters – % of Detractors

However, interpreting the scores is only half the benefit of NPS questionnaire. The second part of “Why” question is equally important if not more than the actual Net Promoter Score itself. By understanding the reasons why your customers may or may not promote your company, product, or service can lead to breakthrough insights.

By understanding the “Why” components of NPS surveys better, you can identify which customer segments are more valuable and what do they want more from your company, product, or service. Moreover, you can also identify the reasons certain customer segments become detractors or passives. 

### Potential Biases
Timing of sending the NPS questionnaire to customers can lead potential bias on the results. For example, if you sent out the survey shortly after you have upset several customers, they will not give high scores on the questions. Likewise, if you have recently made several customers happy, they will rate your customer, product, or service higher.
