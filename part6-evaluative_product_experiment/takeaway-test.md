# Takeaway Test

## In Brief

A Takeaway Test is an evaluative experiment where you are purposely removing a product feature or function without notifying your existing customers. The intention of this test is to more accurately assess whether or not a specific feature or function is valued by customers.

## Helps Answer

* Is this feature helping customers?
* Can I reduce the complexity of my product?

## Description

### Time Commitment

Solely dependent on the sample size desired for the test. Generally requires at least a week, but for a product where a quantitative result is desired, four weeks may be more appropriate.

### How To

This is a fundamentally easy test to run and is generally used on existing products with a significant user base. The primary goal is to eliminate unnecessary features that may distract the user or otherwise add complexity to product maintenance without adding value.

1. Select the segment of users who will be involved in the test group.
2. * The user segment must be relatively isolated so that a user that has the feature removed can't ask a user who still has access to the feature for support.
   * In some cases removing the feature from a new cohort of users may provide an ideal test group.
3. Do not inform the users about the pending product change.
4. Remove or hide the selected feature.
5. * For example, on a web application, a feature could be hidden from the user interface with minimal effort while keeping the actual feature available and easily re-activated.
6. Observe relevant user behavior and/or metrics.

### Interpreting Results

Removing a commonly used feature or one with considerable value will generally cause an immediate negative reaction from users. So it is relatively easy to identify any change in user behavior. However, users can react negatively to any change in the user experience, regardless if it is positive or negative.

Whether or not users notice the feature has been removed, use actual user behavior and metrics rather than user reports to make a decision. While particularly vocal users may complain about a change, that does not necessarily indicate that removing the feature is negative for the larger population. So we must use care.

In addition, when removing a feature from a large user base, it may require significant time to pass before user behavior stabilizes and an initial wave of complaints stop.

### Potential Biases

Sunk cost bias is when we have put so much effort into a project that we will not abandon it regardless of how little value it adds. Removing a feature frequently leads to this problem. We built this feature, and we will likely react negatively to the idea of removing it.

### Field Tips

* If you think no one ever wants to remove a feature, think about the last time you filed your taxes online or the last time you got lost in a supermarket with too many aisles of useless stuff. - @TriKro
