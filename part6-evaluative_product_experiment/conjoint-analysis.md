# Conjoint Analysis

## In Brief

A complex survey method that estimates psychological tradeoffs that consumers make when evaluating several attributes together. Customers choose among product offerings that have different attributes such as price, screen size, or weight. Statistical analysis is then used to reveal the relative value of each attribute and predict the value of each possible combination of features. It tries to uncover real or hidden drivers that may not be apparent to the respondent themselves. 

## Helps Answer

 * Does a particular new feature have any value in the eyes of the customer?
 * Which product attributes are more/less important to the customer?
 * What dollar value can be assigned with each feature?
 * Which features should we build next?

##Description

Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique used in market research. In the new product context, it aims to create a few customized versions of a product that will appeal to specific segments, rather than offer a generic mass-market version of a product. It's used frequently in testing customer acceptance of new product designs, in assessing the appeal of advertisements, and in service design.

It: 
 * Identifies clusters of consumer preferences, to help identify which features need to be produced together.
 * Determines how groups of people value different attributes (feature, function, benefits) that make up an individual product or service. 
 * Evaluates already created designs.
 * Can be used before designing a product, in order to elicit feature sets that will be more likely to appeal to specific people. 
 
Respondents are shown a set of products, prototypes, mock-ups, or pictures created from a combination of levels from all or some of the constituent attributes. Then they're asked to choose from, rank, or rate the products they are shown. Each example is similar enough that consumers will see them as close substitutes, but dissimilar enough that respondents can clearly determine a preference. 

By collating the responses of participants, conjoint analysis figures out what are the most likely combinations of features that will work for subsets of consumers. The output of such an analysis may consist of individual ratings, rank orders, or preferences among alternative combinations.

### Time Commitment and Resources

One to two hours offline for B2C or 24 hours online to gather responses. For B2B, participant recruitment times can vary widely. Analysis of the data can be very rapid with off-the-shelf software for analyzing less than 10 attributes. For analyzing dozens of factors the expertise and software required can take several weeks and human analysis.

### How To

1.  Create a list of the top three to five product attributes you want to rank based on deep consumer understanding gained from prior experience and research.

2.  No hard and fast rule but a good guideline is: Sample Size = \[ (Total
    \# of levels for all attributes) - (Number of attributes + 1) \] x
    10 -- [*ref*](http://www.quirks.com/articles/a2001/20010602.aspx)

3.  Use software program to mix attributes into new product offerings.

4.  Show participants selected product offerings side by side and have them choose which one they would prefer (see example below from [*Pragmatic Marketing*] (http://pragmaticmarketing.com//resources/conjoint-analysis-101?p=0) article).

5.  Use statistical analysis software (or consultant/service) to analyze the results and compute a relative value ranking for each stand-alone attribute.

6.  Output formula revealing the “ideal” product based upon optimized mix of attributes.

|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

### Interpreting Results

Conjoint analysis can be complex and, depending on the tools and exact statistical method employed, the results from the analysis can be extremely difficult to understand as raw statistical data:

Other methods of displaying the results can be more straightforward, but lack details:

([*Qualtrics Conjoint Types*](http://www.qualtrics.com/research-suite/survey-types/conjoint-types/))

What matters most is:

1.  The relative importance of each attribute compared with the others.

2.  The formula that allows you to predict the relative preferences of any kind of mix.

3.  Elasticity of demand for pricing simulations (presuming that price was an attribute that was tested).

Conjoint analysis is most often used in existing markets where the product attributes are generally known by the customer. When brand new attributes are introduced, customers may not initially understand them and therefore may not be able to accurately include the potential value of those attributes in their choices, producing a false negative of sorts.

For this reason, generative market research methods are generally used before conjoint analysis to ensure that the attributes being tested are the correct one.

The method also tends to be extensive and requires a high level of expertise to design. Early stage innovation projects therefore rarely use this method.

### Potential Biases

**Confirmation Bias:** If administering the surveys face-to-face, overly enthusiastic entrepreneurs will sometimes overexplain, correct, or nonverbally prompt the participant with the desired answer.

**Invalid Target Audience:** Key to the success of conjoint analysis is knowing your audience well enough to be able to create products with a useful mix of attributes to begin with. Conjoint analysis works best for products and services that rely more on logical comparison and less on emotion or impulse.

**Homogenous Market:** Boiling market segments down to a series of equations and values has the drawback of treating every member of that segment identically. This can often be reasonable within the specific price range studied but outside of these ranges, the mix of desirable attributes can change quite dramatically as customers enter and leave the market.

**Indication of Price Sensitivity NOT Exact Pricing:** Conjoint analysis is great for providing an indication about which variables and ranges influence pricing but a separate pricing and elasticity of demand analysis should be performed separately to really nail this down.
