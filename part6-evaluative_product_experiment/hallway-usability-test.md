# Hallway Usability Test

## In Brief

Test for market demand by presenting the value proposition to the customer before the product is ready and asking for upfront payment. A hallway usability test is a faster method to see if a new or updated product function is easy enough to comprehend and use. An experimenter would literally go outside in the hallway of an office building or street to find users to test with. This form of usability test is meant to minimize the potentially long process of user recruiting for testing.
