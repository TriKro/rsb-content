# Name - Focus Group

## In Brief

A focus group is a small group discussion designed to rapidly gain customer feedback on a given topic. It is like customer development, but performed in a group. In the Lean Startup world, it is often criticised for falling into “group think”. The opinions of the most outgoing group members tend to dominate the discussion and distort the outcome. It can also be used to understand the dynamics behind group buying patterns / influences.

## Description

Focus groups are traditional tools that bigger companies use to hear the voice of the consumer/customer. Focus groups are a divergent tool to gather insights based on group conversiations. Focus groups have a long history. They were first used over 60 years ago by US government sociologists investigating the effectiveness of WWII military propaganda movies. They are most often used in the context of:
 * media consumption
 * consumer product advertising
 * traditional market research

According to Harvard Business Professor, Gerald Zaltman, focus groups tap into only about 5% of people's thought processes — the 5% that lies above the level of consciousness.

Focus groups are quick and easy to design and use, particularly if there is a bigger budget available, as there are many companies and third parties that help recruit and organise focus group sessions. 

If used as a source of idea generation, they tend be more effective than if used as a tool for verification. Overall, they are used to try to understand "unarticulated needs", directly in the voice of the customer. 

### Time Commitment

3 days prep (much less if you outsource participant recruitment) + 90 minutes per session + 1-4 hours to collate results

### How To

 1. Pick a single, clear purpose. Single product or issue.
 2. Narrow down your target audience. Pick and talk to one group at a time.
 3. Consider organizing a control group. To contrast group opinions against a larger market context.
 4. Refrain from using the focus group for ulterior motives. 
 5. Find a second facilitator. Helps with notetaking and all other organisational issues to avoid group distractions.
 6. Choose a comfortable venue and recording method. Comfort and safety are critical when helping participants relax.
 7. Prepare questions up to 10 questions.
  * Use open-ended questions. 
  * Establish rapport. 
  * Avoid jargon. 
  * Avoid embarrasing or intimidating questions if you can, or only ask them towards the end of a session if they feel comfortable. 
 8. Plan out how you will record data. Consider 
  * Post its
  * Evernote
  * Excel
  * Software tools
 9. Recruit 6-10 participants, using appropriate incentives/goodies. 
  * Advertising
  * Specialized focus group recruiter
  * Other existing marketing channels (from business model canvas)
 10. Pass out consent forms at the beginning of the meeting
 11. Have everyone introduce themselves.
 12. Announce the purpose of the meeting, say it's being recorded, and that the purpose of the meeting is a brainstorming session in order to get participants' opinions.
 13. Ask questions. Use your original ones, but also throuw in other ones. Ideally, participants will start to talk among themselves so that you can withdraw from the conversation at some point.
 14. Stay neutral and empathatic. Establish eye contact with participants who are speaking less. 
 15. Take written notes during the session (assistant), including non-verbal cues as well as what was said. 
 16. Prevent any individual from dominating the discussion. Use questions like "Does anyone else have a different perspective?"
 17. Finish anywhere between 45 and 90 minutes after the start.
 18. Provide a feedback form
 19. Repeat if you can. Run a few focus groups, just to get a diversity of opinions.

### Interpreting Results

Use techniques to match patterns in responses, like affinity mapping using post-its. Also, note down language used by customers as well as any ideas generated during the discussion as a source of inspiration for further evaluation. 

### Potential Biases

 * Confirmation bias: Don't use focus groups to tell you what you already know. Listen for divergent opinions or the unexpected.
 * False positive: Your focus group may tell you things which aren't true for your market as a whole
 * Difference between what customers say vs what they do/buy: Assume consumers are not capable of accurately describing why they make decisions
 * Ability of moderator to lead a session: Moderators need to have enough skill to lead a group and manage the dynamic so that you don't lose useful information.
 * Unrepresentative sampling: Choosing the wrong participants devalues any insights you gain, as they won't be actionable.
 * Your own ulterior motives: Don't turn a focus group into a PR or sales opportunity. It will skew your results.

### Field Tips
 * Start focus groups with simple questions which build comfort level
 * Check technical equipment before starting a focus group and have a contingency plan in place.
 * Focus group members may bring up false information or offensive opinions. Have a plan in place to handle them.
