# What's a Real Book

Go to any jazz jam session and you’ll see one book on stage: _The Real Book_.  

Every serious musician has it.

_The Real Book_ is a large tome with text that looks like someone took handwritten music charts, photocopied them, and then stuck them in a binder.

Each page is a jazz standard. "All Blues" by Miles Davis, "Autumn Leaves" by Johnny Mercer, "A Night in Tunisia" by Dizzy Gillespie, and even more esoteric tunes like "Peaches in Regalia" by Frank Zappa.

Unlike various “fake books” out there that provide details on how to play each note and where to put your fingers, _The Real Book_ was minimal. Each page had the key signature, time signature, chords, melody line, and not much else. It was just enough detail to play the song. It was vague enough to allow for the extensive improvisation that makes jazz jazz.[^1]

It was heaven.

_The Real Book_ answered a simple question for musicians: “How do we play that song?”

Where a musician’s job is to play songs, the startup product manager’s job is to learn. Learn about our customers, our value propositions, our channels. Learn about all the pieces of our business model.

The goal for _The Real Startup Book_ is to answer a simple question for startups: “How do I learn about the different aspects of my business model?”

We have unanswered questions about our business, and the answers lie out in the real world with real users. With each question we ask about our business model, there is a method to answer it.

_The Real Startup Book_ will help us find those answers by showing us which methods are the most appropriate. The methods should be adaptable for our situation, in our industry, in our country, and in our business model.

It should not be overly dogmatic. It should leave room for interpretation. Depending on our unique circumstances, we can still improvise.

This is not a textbook, it’s not a “How To” guide, and it’s not a “fake book.” It’s a well-organized toolbox to help you find the right tool for the job at hand.  

Keep it, refer to it, and toss it to the side when you need it.  
More importantly, please write on it. Scribble, scratch, and change it.

[^1] Of course I learned much later that _The Real Book_ was illegal.  
First published in 1971, it didn’t pay any royalties to the musicians who wrote the songs. But it was the standard book that everyone used because it was the most complete and accurate.  
It was also published in multiple keys so that musicians with varying instruments would be able to refer to the same song, with even identical page numbers, and not miss a beat.  
Nowadays, _The Real Book_ is legitimate and is published by Hal Leonard, which does pay royalties as appropriate.
