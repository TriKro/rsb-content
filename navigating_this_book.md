         <h1>Navigating<br />This Book</h1>

         <p>Do not read this book straight through. Read this Index thoroughly, then reference other pages as needed.</p>

         <p>This book is not a step 1, step 2, step 3 guide to building a startup. Startups don’t work like that.</p>

         <p>Think of this book as a toolbox.</p>

         <p>Like any toolbox, it’s organized to help us find what we’re looking for when we need it. When we need a way to test market demand, there’s a section on Evaluative Market Experiments. When we’re looking to prioritize our ever growing feature list into a Minimum Viable Product, there’s a section on Generative Product Research.</p>

         <p>The index for navigating this book is not alphabetical, chronological, or ontological. The index is ordered by what you’re trying to learn. Are you trying to learn about your customer? How to price your product?
         What will make your users come back?</p>

         <p>It is highly recommended that you read the index thoroughly. You will not get the major benefit of this book without it.</p>

         <p>When faced with an unknown aspect of your business model, first figure out what you need to learn. What’s your learning goal? What question are you trying to ask?</p>

         <p>Once you know what you need to learn, consult the index to find a list of research and experimental methods that will help. Then read each method and determine which will work best for your situation and resources.</p>

                  <p>All the methods are tagged XV so as to be easily searchable depending on any other frameworks we might use. This includes simple tags such as qualitative or quantitative used to denote the type of information that the method produces.</p>

                  <p>It also includes tags related to the type of business model, such as:</p>

                  <p>— B2B - For Business-to- Business<br />
                     — B2C - For Business-to- Consumer<br />
                     — B2G - For Business-to- Government<br />
                     — 2-Sided Market<br /> 
                     - For a business with buyers and sellers.</p>

                  <p>Using these tags to navigate
                     the methods is not as simple as using the Index and may result
                     in a large selection of methods not entirely suited to the learning goal, but can be helpful to further narrow down the methods, so we’ve included them.</p>
