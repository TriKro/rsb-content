**What Are the Next Steps?**

"I'm not of the opinion that the next logical step for a book is for it to be made into a film.”  
—_Jasper Fforde_

**For You**  
This book won’t make you successful. You have to work for that. Entrepreneurship is not an academic theory; it’s a practice. So to get better at it, just do it!

Figure out what question you have about your product or market, pick a method, and start practicing.
