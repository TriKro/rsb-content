## In Brief
A combination of semi-structured interview and observations done in the actual location where the problem occurs or the solution will be used. This method avoids hypothetical statements and helps reveal knowledge that the customer may have, but be unaware of and thus unable to communicate in a traditional interview. It may also reveal substitute products, competitors, or workarounds that will help define the optimal solution.

## Helps Answer
- What are the customer’s pain points?
- What are the jobs to be done?
- How often does this problem occur?
- Are there makeshift solutions the customer is currently using?
- Does the customer have any tacit knowledge about the problem space that would help create a solution?

## Description

### Time Commitment and Resources 
Can be very expensive depending on the proximity to the customer and the frequency of their problem. In some cases, the problem is unpredictable and a large amount of time can be spent either waiting for the problem to occur or simulating an occurrence.

Expect at least one hour per customer with a minimum of five customers, and two hours to debrief.

It is helpful to have already conducted Customer Discovery Interviews and have both customer personas and a preliminary storyboard of the user experience.

### How To

#### Preparation

- Arrange the time and place for the interview, making sure it is the time and place where the customer would typically have the problem.
- Prepare a framing statement

#### Conduct the Interview

- Frame the Interview
- The researcher must establish rapport and put the customer at ease.
- The customer must not feel judged. 
- The researcher is there to learn.
- Establish the rules for observation. 
- The customer will be doing work so the research must establish up front when they can or can not interrupt the workflow to ask questions.

#### Observation

- The researcher should take notes on the workflow, asking questions to clarify any points of confusion.
- Take care to note extraneous activities which may be outside the scope of the solution to be designed, but may impact the workflow of the user. E.g. Coworkers engaging in distracting chit-chat

#### Summarize
- Summarize the observations and ask the customer for confirmation.
- Ask any additional clarifying questions.

### Interpreting Results
A number of different debriefing methods can be used after reviewing recordings or notes. These could include Affinity diagramming, Card sorting, or creating Jobs to be Done.

Since the data is primarily qualitative in nature and sample sizes are small, researchers must be careful not extrapolate a pattern of behavior to the entire population but can usually synthesize a clear hypothesis for further evaluative testing methods.

### Potential Biases
- Confirmation Bias

### Field Tips
- “Apprentice yourself to the customer and learn how they are currently solving their problems without your product.” - @TriKro
