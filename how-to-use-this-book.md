# How to Use This Book

Do not read this book straight through. There is no plot or narrative that you’re going to miss.

This book is not a step 1, step 2, step 3 guide to building a startup. Startups don’t work like that.

There are certain sections that you’ll want to read thoroughly, such as the Intro and Index. Those sections allow you to figure out which parts of the rest of the book are relevant to you and your startup. Read those parts, then reference the methods described in the remaining pages as needed.

-

Think of this book as a toolbox.

Like any toolbox, it’s organized to help us find what we’re looking for when we need it. When we need a way to test market demand, there’s a section on **Evaluative Market Experiments**. When we’re looking to prioritize our ever growing feature list into a **Minimum Viable Product**, there’s a section on **Generative Product Research**.

We must know what tool we need before taking it out and using it. As innovators, we must be wary of [Maslow’s Hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument), and make sure that we understand what research/experimental method or technique we need before we wind up repeatedly hitting ourselves in the thumb.

The index for navigating this book is not alphabetical, chronological, or ontological. The index is ordered by what you’re trying to learn. Are you trying to learn about your customer? How to price your product? What will make your users come back?

-

It is _highly_ recommended that you read the index thoroughly. You will not get the major benefit of this book without it.

When faced with an unknown aspect of your business model, first figure out what you need to learn. What’s your learning goal? What question are you trying to ask?

Once you know what you need to learn, consult the index to find a list of research and experimental methods that will help. Then read each method and determine which will work best for your situation and resources.
