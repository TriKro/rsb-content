## Description

"Digital business models are a bit of a misnomer. It’s not digital technology that defines them; it’s their ability to create exponential value. The music and video industries, for example, weren’t redefined by converting analog to digital formats. Just ask Sony about Minidisc players and Netflix about their DVD business." source: https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-to-create-an-exponential-mindset

## Case Studies
 * Example: When selling a digital information product the experiment team gathered early versions of this data “by hand”, then produced a printed report for the test customers. This printed report provided real value, and was used to gather feedback. Eventually, the team created a digital version of this report. source: http://www.movestheneedle.com/blog/enterprise-lean-startup-experiment-examples/
 * Artivest had to deal with analog paperwork before they could deliver a digital version of its FinTech platform for individuals and IFAs: https://leanstartup.co/how-one-fitech-company-used-lean-startup-in-a-regulated-industry/ There was both an operational component and a regulatory one to the the analog paperwork.
 * Kate Spade retail stores use iPads to change storefront displays quickly, to avoid the cost of printing and to test & track easily. https://www.fastcodesign.com/1672132/kate-spade-reinvents-retail-as-a-lean-startup ???
 * Internet of Things: first design the physical object, then connect it to networks and deliver a digital service.
