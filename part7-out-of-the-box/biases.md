# Biases

## Cognitive
- Anchoring Effect: Basing subsequent judgements of an event based on the event’s first piece of information.
- Availability Bias: Judging an event because of how easy you can think of examples of the event.
- Central Tendency: Categorizing and judging information as it relates to a prototype while ignoring variation. 
- Confirmation Bias: Seeking information and evidence that supports your beliefs and hypotheses, while ignoring conflicting information.
- Curse of Knowledge: Lacking empathy towards others because of you know more than another person about a particular subject.
- Fundamental Attribution Error: Thinking that people behave a certain way due to their personality and not the situation in which they find themselves in. 
- Halo Effect: Overvaluing the overall, good impression of a person, brand, product, organization, etc., which makes it easier to overlook any bad impression.
- Hindsight Bias: Thinking that you knew-it-all-along; however, prior to the event happening, you had no basis for your prediction.
- Observer Bias: Influencing the research because, you, as the observer know of the study’s goals and objectives.
- Overconfidence: A belief that you’re better than others, and that negative outcomes can happen to others (but not me).
- Primacy Effect: Recalling and emphasizing information that happened towards the beginning of an experience.
- Recall Bias: An incomplete and inaccurate remembering of past events or experiences. 
- Recency Effect:  Recalling and emphasizing information that happened towards the end of an experience.
- Response Bias: Range of biases that influences subject’s responses away from a truthful response.
- Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Expecting others to behave a certain way. Seeing the other person’s actions confirms your expectations.

## Research
- Framing Effect: Seeing differences in experimental results because of differing contexts and situations, apart from experimental variables.
- False Negative: A result that appears negative when it should not. 
- False Positive: A result that appears positive when it should not.
- Measurement Bias: Systematic error in measurement or classification for participants in study.
- Omitted-Variable Bias : Leaving out one or more causal variables in a statistical model.
- Planning Effect: A belief that you’ve accurately estimated the planned work.
- Selection Bias: Erroneously choosing participants to study, which affect your study results.
