         <p>If you’ve ever recognized a giant hole in your business model and had no idea how to go about filling in the unknown, this book is for you.</p>

         <p><b>You may be asking:</b><br />
            — Who are our customers?<br />
            — What are the most important features of our product?<br />
            — Why are people doing that?<br />
            — Will people actually pay for this?</p>

         <p>This book is for managing innovation projects where the business model is partly or completely unknown.</p>

         <p><b>Your job title might be:</b><br />
            — Product Manager<br />
            — CEO of an early stage startup<br />
            — Entrepreneur in Residence
         </p>

         <p><b>Previous Experience</b><br />
            You should be familiar with concepts such as: — Lean Startup<br />
            — User Experience<br />
            — Human Centered Design / Design Thinking<br />
            — Business Model Canvas</p>

         <p>It’s ok if you haven’t heard of any of these terms, but you’ll get a lot more out of it if you have.</p>

         <p>In particular, you should already be bought into the idea that there are parts of your business model that are unknown and the way to figure that out is to do research and experiments out of the building and in the real world with your customers.</p>

         <p><b>Innovation at Scale</b><br />
            This book is particularly useful for those managing or assisting large numbers of innovation products. This includes:<br />
            — Chief Innovation Officer<br />
            — VP of Innovation<br />
            — Accelerator Manager<br />
            — Lean Startup / Innovation Coach</p>

         <p>If this is you, you’ll find this book serves as a versatile and handy quick</p>

         <p>reference guide for almost any startup you’ll be dealing with. It can also be used to diagnose typical startup problems.</p>

         <p>It is also a Creative Commons project which means you can use it as training material for your startups without any additional cost.</p>

         <p><b>Business Model</b><br />
            This book is best used to answer questions about certain business model elements such as the Customer, the Value Proposition, Channel, Relationship, & Revenue. In other words, the critical elements in Product / Market Fit.</p>

         <p>While many of the methods listed here can be used to investigate other business model elements such as Partners & Resources, it may take some interpretation on the part of the reader.</p>

         <p><b>Stage and Industry</b><br />
            The methods here work fine for small, early stage startups and equally
            fine for teams in large companies trying something new, risky, and outside the normal business model.
            It also works for any industry, but there is a bias towards providing
            examples and case studies from the technology industry. Other
            industries will be included as case studies become available. Please
            send any such case studies to <a href="mailto: realbook@trikro.com">realbook@trikro.com</a> to be included.</p>

         <p><b>Warnings: Academics and Existing Businesses</b><br />
            This book is not for students trying to learn in a static academic environment. You’ll have to go out and use this book in the real world with real customers to get anything out of it. So if your teacher just handed this to you, get ready to get kicked out of the building to go talk to customers.</p>

         <p>This book is also not for companies executing on an existing business model. While some of the techniques listed here may work quite well for optimizing an existing product or service, it’s not designed for that and traditional product management methods might be more appropriate.</p>

         <p><b>Continual Improvement</b><br />
            Future improvements may change or broaden the focus on this book. This is a living document which will be updated regularly.</p>
