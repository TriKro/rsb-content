## In Brief

A scorecard is an evaluative decision-making or prioritizing shortcut, often done in a spreadsheet. It forces you to choose criteria that are important, then to weight each criterion, and finally to multiply or weight each value in order to generate a number which can then be used to rank all options being considered. It is a structured way to identify one top choice among a number of options, to help focus your use of resources (time, money). This can be useful if there is no clear intuitive priority.
