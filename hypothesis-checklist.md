# Writing a Good Hypothesis

Lean startup practices turn project managers, business leaders and designers into scientists who constantly validate their ideas through running an array of experiments. But experiments can get out of hand and turn perfectly sane people into mad scientists. A sure way to keep one’s sanity is to start the experiment with a strong hypothesis.

A strong hypothesis will give structure to the experiment. It will tell you what you are testing and what you expect to get out of the test. By stating the expectations, you are stating the goals that the experiment has to hit to make it a success or failure. This will help you define when to determine that the experiment needs to be scrapped or if it is ready to be taken to market.



Key elements of writing a good hypothesis:



1. The change that you are making

2. The aspect that will change

3. The success or fail metric

4. How long are you going to run the test



A hypothesis will end up looking like this:

**This new feature** will cause **an 10% increase** of **new users visiting the homepage** in **3 months**.

The change                                     the metric                               the impact                   the timeframe 

Let’s break down each aspect:
