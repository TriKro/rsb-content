				<p>In school, we’re constantly taking tests to gauge how well we’ve learned last week’s material. We cram geographic boundaries, the dates of battles, and multiplication tables into our heads and spit out the results.</p>
				<p>Sadly, those rote memorization skills and the ability to answer pre-formulated questions doesn’t help us when we embark on entrepreneurship. When building a new business model, there is no test or quiz which we can cram for. It’s as if we sat down for our final and open up the exam book only to find a blank piece of paper in front of us.</p>
				<p>“Where is the test?” we ask.<br />
				   “Right there in front of you,” answers our teacher.<br />
				   “Is there a right answer?” we hesitantly inquire.<br /> 
				   “Yes there is,” assures our teacher.<br />
				   “What are the questions?” we plead.<br />
				   “That’s what you have to figure out.”
				</p>
				<p>As an entrepreneur (or intrapreneur) we can’t just guess at the answers without first identifying the right questions to ask. If we just guess by building a fully functioning product, it’s very likely that the market will judge us wrong and punish us with zero sales and bankruptcy.</p>
				<p class="coloured-paragraph">Our job, as an entrepreneur, is to first ask the right questions and only then to find the right answers.</p>

				<h3 class="icon-heading writing">What is the Right Question?</h3>

				<p>The questions we must answer are fundamental holes in our business model. Questions like:</p>

				<p>— Who is our customer?</p>
				<p>— What job do they want done?</p>
				<p>— What channels can we use to reach them?</p>
				<p>— Which features should we build for our first product?</p>
				<p>— Is our solution good enough?</p>

				<p class="coloured-paragraph">If we can identify the right question, there is a corresponding method or methods listed in this book to help answer that question.</p> 
				<p>Depending on the resources and time constraints, one of the methods may be simpler to execute.</p>
				<p>If we attempt to execute a method in this book without first identifying the right question to ask, the results of that experiment are typically very difficult if not impossible to interpret correctly.</p>
				<p>For example, let’s say we’re selling a new type of shoe that cures plantar fasciitis. We put up a landing page test (a type of smoke test) with our value prop and a “buy now” button. Then we put $1000 in to Google Adwords for “shoes” to drive traffic and sit back to wait for the money to start rolling in.</p>
				<p>...and our conversion rate is 0% Should we give up? That’s what the landing page test says. There is insufficient demand for this product. But what is plantar fasciitis? Exactly. All those people coming to our site are asking the same thing.</p>
				<p>Is our test failing because customers aren’t interested? Or do they fail because they simply can’t understand the value proposition? Or are we just focused on the wrong channel?</p>
				<p>In this case, we were asking “Does anyone want my product?” when we should be asking “Does our customer understand what plantar fasciitis is?” or even “Who is our customer?”</p>
