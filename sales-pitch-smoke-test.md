# Name Sales Pitch Smoke Test

## In Brief

Conducting a sales pitch as a smoke test is when an entrepreneur pitches a value proposition to a potential user or customer for the purpose of gathering feedback on a problem. This method is versatile because it can also help you gather insight on a solution you have built and whether or not a target market is willing to pay to use your solution. During a sales pitch, you are looking to discover pains, learn the impact of those pains, confirm that there is value to the customer in solving those pains, and pitch a solution to those pains. This is related to the Flyer smoke test.

## Description

If you are building a for-profit business, nothing really starts happening until something is sold. While it's a test of founder gumption, the primary (learning) purpose of pitching a product is to force the target prospect to make a decision. 

As a smoke test, initial sales are particularly valuable when testing in the early stages. The ad copy, product packaging, and value proposition are still up for grabs in a B2C context. In a B2B context, it's often possible to tailor the product or service to the company's needs. Actual sales prove that you have a combination that works in the prospect's eyes. 

### Time Commitment

Tends to vary significantly based on cost of product and method of distribution. 
* At one extreme, you have low dollar value products. Figuring out where to sell and place the product tends to take some time. Yet the actual purchase will tend to be an impulse buy. 
* At the other extreme, a large enterprise sale can take months if not years and many meeting with multiple decision makers. For the main decisionmaker, it's not just a financial decision as the success of the purchase can impact their career trajectory. 

### How To

1. Establish contact via a channel that is working for you. Traditional techniques include cold calling, door-to-door sales, or piggy backing on existing marketing and lead generation systems (if any).
2. Meet with the prospect in person
3. Establish rapport and trust
 * Show warm interest
 * Don't be needy
 * Do your homework and check out the prospect on social media before meeting them (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc)
4. Ask well thought-out and observant questions. Match the customer's motivations with product attributes. 
5. If/when appropriate, pitch the product 
6. After the pitch, expect objections and be ready to handle them
 * This is where you will learn the most about how your prospect perceives your offer and your product
 * Listen closely and give the prospect a chance to explain what's bothering them
 * If appropriate repeat the concern back to the prospect to make sure that you understand what they're saying
 * Explore the underlying reasons
7. Close the sale
 * "Does this sound like something you want?"
 * "So do you want to pay now or pay next Tuesday?"
 * "We’ve got a 20% discount just for customers who sign up today.”
 * “So we have the Networked Toaster, the 10-year comprehensive guarantee, and our free delivery and installation service. When would be a good time to deliver?”
 * “In your opinion, does what I am offering solve your problem?”
 * “Is there any reason why we can't proceed with the shipment?"
 * “If we sign the contract today, we can start work on these concerns first thing tomorrow morning. Is that something you would be willing to commit to?”
