			<p class="intro-text">A Comprehension Test will evaluate whether the customer understands the marketing message explaining the value proposition. This eliminates a possible false negative bias on smoke tests where the customer indicates they do not want the value proposition when they actually do not understand it.</p>

					<li><span>3.</span> Ask them to explain the value proposition in their own words from memory.</li>

				<h3 class="icon-heading">Interpreting Results</h3>

				<p>If the participant’s explanation is roughly comparable to our own, we count that as a positive result. If not, then it’s a negative. For this sort of test, we generally want a sample size of about 20 people and a positive conversion of about 80%.</p>
				<p>The conversion has to be very high because regardless of what our value proposition is, people should understand it.</p>
				<p>Take note: if many of the participants use identical language to explain the value proposition back, it should be considered as possible alternative marketing messages.</p>

				<h3 class="icon-heading">Potential Biases</h3>
				<h4>Confirmation Bias</h4>
				<p>Overly enthusiastic entrepreneurs will sometimes over explain, correct, or nonverbally prompt the participant with the correct answer.</p>

				<h4>Invalid Target Audience</h4>
				<p>Participants do not need to be the target customers, but they must have the same level of language & vocabulary as the target customer. e.g. A junior marketing manager can be used instead of a Chief Marketing Officer</p>

				<h4>False Negative</h4>
				<p>When using online surveys such as FiveSecondTest, the distractions of an online can often result in a higher than normal failure rate.</p>
