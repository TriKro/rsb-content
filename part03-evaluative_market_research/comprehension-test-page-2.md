				<p>If the participant’s explanation is roughly comparable to our own, we count that as a positive result. If not, then it’s a negative. For this sort of test, we generally want a sample size of about 20 people and a positive conversion of about 80%.<br />
				The conversion has to be very high because regardless of what our value proposition is, people should understand it.<br/>
				Take note: if many of the participants use identical language to explain the value proposition back, it should be considered as possible alternative marketing messages.</p>
