# Fake Door Smoke Test

## In Brief

People are bad at predicting what they want, but great at reacting to new offers. Building just the entry to an offer makes it possible to predict future reactions based on actual behavior. This test is also known as a 404 page test. 

## Helps Answer
- Is the customer interested enough to click?
- Which target audience is attracted?
- Which words/icons/images work well?

## Description
The fake door or 404 page test is a quantitative validation method that is useful in two circumstances:
 
- To test if your idea arouses the interest of potential customers.
- To test if an additional feature is a welcome addition to an existing product.  

The idea of this test is to build a fake advertisement or button on a website to gauge the interest of potential users by looking at the click-through rate. The fake door could link to a “coming soon” page and could prompt the user to add their email address to be notified when the product or feature is available.

### Advantages
An idea can be validated quickly without spending a lot of time and money on development. Data is generated on users actual behavior rather than asking them if they would be interested.

### Ethics
Fake door testing could be thought of as tricking customers and decreasing the credibility of the product or business. When used carefully and in moderation it can save time and money and lead to the development of a better product. 

Clear communication that the feature or product is in development can help the user not be as upset that the product or feature isn’t available.

### Internal & External Fake Doors

The internal fake door is great for testing to determine if a potential new feature is appealing to current users. Usually a link or button is created on a website to this new function. 

For example on a local news website a button that says: “Switch to map view”, when the information is currently presented in a tile-view. If users are satisfied with how  the information is presented, it is likely they will not click this button. If users assume a map view would better suit their needs, then it is likely they will click. The click-through rate (the amount of clicks divided by the number of views) will help to gauge user interest.

Be careful when interpreting results. For example, the location of a button can have more influence than the button itself. Make sure to experiment with placing buttons in different locations.  


Using an external fake door is a great test if your concept is interesting for a certain audience. A common way to test this is using a ‘fake ad’. For example: you have the idea of starting an online community for Kingfisher-enthusiasts. This community gathers on a website. Before building a complete website, you set up a test and check if there are more kingfisher enthusiasts looking for such an online community. Beforehand you determine that if more than 5% of all views convert to a click, enough users are interested in an online community. Doing so, you can simply test if your idea suits the need.  

Be careful: The text in the header and body of your Ad have great impact on how people react to the advertisement. Therefore always try a variation of sentences in your headers and body of the Ad to overcome this bias.   
  
Fake doors are not suitable for testing your minimum viable product and basic functionality. Some functionalities are considered to be so essential, that you just need them. For example your Registration-process.
 
### How To
1. Write down hypothesis. Each test starts with writing down your key assumptions in the form of an hypothesis.
2. Build the fake door(s). Make sure you would represent the feature in the same way as it would become. If you exaggerate the button or particularly highlight the link, your results will be biased and therefore useless.  
3. Make sure that you also include a method of measuring. With fake Ad’s the channel takes care of this: Google, Facebook, Twitter all give metrics on how your ad’s perform. And you might as well track the number of visits on the page you send them to. If the link is on your website; add a ‘google tracking event’  to your button, or create a special landing page so you can track the amount of visitors. 
4. Measure
5. Run the experiment. And try to be patient. Don’t draw conclusions too soon, wait for the test to complete (in this case till you have at least 1000 visits or 10.000 views). 

### Interpreting Results
Check your initial hypothesis and see if the results match your success-rate: 
depending on your results you have three options: 
- Success! Congratulations, you were right. You decide to build the feature.
- No success! You pivot. Try reframing the link or button. A different word/icons/picture might give a totally different outcome. 
- No success! Congratulations. You successfully prevented yourself from wasting a lot of scarce resources.  

### Time Commitment
- 1 hour to formulate hypothesis 
- 1 - 4 hours to create the fake doors. Depending on the type.\
- 1- 10 days to generate enough traffic for a representative sample size (depending on the amount of traffic or money you’re willing to spend)
- 1 hour to evaluate and write down learnings. 

### Potential Biases
- Copy Bias: The word used in the fake door have great influence on your results. Make sure you try different variations.
- Location Bias. The location of your ad (which platform) or you link (relative position on your website) have great influence. Make sure you try different variations. 

### Field Tips
- Don’t scare off your users. Testing is okay, but be careful not to overdo this. 
- Making (too many) false promises by fake doors might give the user an idea of a lousy product, or of an company that tricks me. 
- Make sure you have a significant amount of users in order to judge.

## Case Studies
- Gamestudio Zynga has a strong reputation of using fake doors and other quantitative product testing. They test new game ideas by  coming up with a five-word pitch for each one. Then they would publish the pitch as a  promotional link in there live games for a period of time to see how much interest it generates from existing users.

- Local Dutch information aggregator Tippiq.nl uses fake doors extensively in their proposition development using a separate website (with www.tippiqlabs.nl). All new ideas are tested first using fake ads that will lead to a landing page on that website. On the landing page the product/service is explained and the visitor is asked if he would like to use the product. After they have expressed their interest they get a notification that the product is still in development and that they can leave their email if they want to stay up to date.
