# Data Mining

## In Brief
Data mining uses statistics from large amounts of data to learn about target markets and customer behaviors. Data mining can make use of data warehouses or big data.

## Helps Answer
- Who is our customer?
- What are their preferences?
- How do they rank planned feature sets?

## Description
Data mining can start with a result from a few questionnaires. However, it is more effective to use a large dataset. Identifying the source information (where you get the data) and extracting the key values (how you pick the data points) are two important aspects in getting the quality results. 

Data mining is best used for pattern discovery in customer perceptions and behaviors. It is useful in understanding your customers and/or your target market. 

For example, by using email campaigns and gathering the results, you can identify the profile of potential buyers or customers. This data point can help in your customer acquisition efforts.

By sending out customer satisfaction questionnaires or feedbacks, you can gather customer information. Alternatively, you can also track customer behaviors or mouse clicks on your websites. By combining these two data points, you can determine customer behavioral links between reported satisfaction and actual usage. This can identify key drivers for customer loyalty and churn. 

### Time Commitment and Resources 
Depending on the amount of data that you need to crunch and data points that you want to discover, it will take 2-3 hours to a few weeks. You should pick one or two most important data points to start the learning process.

### How To
You can either acquire outside (industry or market) data or distill your own (customer or product) data. Once you identify the area that you want to test:

1. Acquire data (integrate from various sources, if required)
2. Identify data points (determine which data or information is relevant to the research)
3. Transform and extract data (many tools to choose from business intelligent tools to database software with built-in reporting tools)
4. Recognize and search for patterns
5. Draw conclusions or refine the process by starting at step 2 (or sometimes even start back from step 1 to acquire better data).

### Interpreting Results
In data mining, data matters but perspective matters more. There is a saying “Garbage In, Garbage Out.” But as human beings, we tend to see what we want to see and draw conclusions based on our own biases.  

To counter these biases, you can:
1. Get outside help or another pair of eyes to help interpret the data
2. Get two data points that are counter to each other (in research methodology, that will be called the Control Group and Experimental Group)

### Potential Biases
- Confirmation Bias
- False Positives
- Ignorance of Black Swans (rare and unprecedented events that can dramatically change or determine the future outcome)
