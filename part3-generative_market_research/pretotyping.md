# Pretotyping

## In Brief

Pretotyping tests the initial appeal and actual usage of a potential new product by simulating its core experience with the smallest possible investment of time and money. One often cited reason for prototyping is to test if what you want to build is technically feasible. Another perspective on prototyping is to answer the question "should we build it?". Since the biggest risk is not if we can build it, but actually to find a market for it in the first place, it's only logical that the first step of prototyping should be focused on understanding market needs (as in jobs-to-be-done) rather than technical constraints. The term was coined by Alberto Savoia (formerly Innovation Agitator at Google).

## Helps Answer
 * Is "it" worth building?
 * Who might be interested in "it"?
 * How would they want to use "it"?
 * What's the right problem to solve?
 * What would the use "it" for?

## Description

There are many different techniques available, so although this list may seem long, it's far from complete. Techniques included in pretotyping include:

 * Mechanical Turk/Wizard of Oz
 * Concierge
 * The Pinochio
 * The One Night Stand
 * The Provincial
 * The Fake Door
 * Landing Page Smoke Test
 * Crowdfunding 
 * The Impersonator
 * The Teaser
 * The Infiltrator
 * Pretend-to-Own
 * The Minimum Viable Product
 * The Holodeck
 * Picnic in the Graveyard
 * The Want Ad
 * Family Tree

### Time Commitment

While the time horizon for prototyping often is months or years, the aim of pretotyping is to return insightful user data within days or weeks.

### How To

Mix and match any of the above techniques to construct experiments. See the other chapters for more details.

### Interpreting Results

Before launching an experiment by using any of the above mentioned techniques, you should set a measurable target. What does "success" mean to you? 

Often in the early stage of a new venture, simple cheap tests can be extremely informative. Let's say you're running a Smoke Test to verify initial demand for a new idea. Out of 1 000 views, you get only 10 clicks and zero sign-ups. Something tells you this is a bummer! But let's say you get 1 000 views, 10 clicks and 8 sign-ups. This tells you that you probably have to look closer at the ad copy.

### Potential Biases

Pretotyping in particular is about minimizing bias by not blindly following false positives and negatives (opinions) about an idea and instead collecting feedback from actual user and product tests (data). 

Common biases include:
 * interviewer bias
 * confirmation bias
 * response bias
