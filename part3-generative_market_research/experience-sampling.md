# Experience Sampling

## In Brief
This research method is used to get information about a participant's daily behaviors, thoughts and feelings in real time or as close to as possible. Participants are asked to stop at certain times in their natural settings and make notes of their experiences. It is also known as daily diary or experience sampling method (ESM).

## Helps Answer
- Who is our customer?
- What are their pains?
- What are the jobs to be done?
- How do we find them?

## Description
The key element to experience sampling, is asking the right question. You need to be very careful in phrasing it, since you will be asking the question over and over again. This method makes most sense when you want to solve a frequently reoccurring problem. You get the most useful and viable input when asking about repeated behavior, and more specifically the last time it occurred.

## Time Commitment & Resources
How much data you want to collect determines the time your participants should commit to this method. The more data you get, the more confident are your interpretations. You should aim for at least 100 data points, depending on your goals and customer segment. There are three dimensions into which you can expand your data pool: how many times a day are you asking the question, on how many days are you asking the question, and the number of participants you ask the question to about repeated behavior. Keep in mind that usually two thirds of the answers will be useful and adjust your planning accordingly.

The recruiting process will often take up a lot of time since only participants who are part of your target group can ensure valuable data. That’s why you will need to create a screener to make sure the participants qualify for your target group. How long the recruiting takes depends on how many participants you want and could range from a day to multiple days. One fast and cheap way to find them is to look in social media settings corresponding to the theme of your study. 

If you plan on a big amount of data you should have a team ready to analyze that data. Aim for a couple of analyzing sessions, each after a certain amount of data is obtained. The first session will take the longest and depending on the amount of data could range from two hours to a day. 

You should offer your participants some kind of incentive, measured on the amount of answers they were giving - ranging from $5 to $50, a coupon or similar.

## How To

### Preparation
- Carefully phrase the question.
- Make sure the answering process takes no more than a minute.
- Plan how often you want to send alerts - how many times a day, distribution over the days. Be careful with the frequency. If the behavior doesn’t happen in the time between alerts, the questions can be nagging very quickly.
- Choose your medium of contact - sms, phone, email, app, ..
- Plan how to collect the data - spreadsheet is common.
- Decide how many participants you want and start recruiting as soon as possible.
- Plan the analysis depending on the expected amount of data - team size, process, etc.

### Finding Participants
- Use a screener to select relevant participants.
- Identify participant criteria and formulate questions accordingly - if possible use quantifying questions (e.g. how often participant does something).
- Additionally think of non-criteria that your questions might not cover yet.
- Check willingness to participate by collecting contact information.
- Check the availability. 
- Select your participants.
- Set their expectations on how often they will be asked to give answers.

### Start Collecting Data 
Remember to thank the participants for each participation.

### Analysis
- Check the first answers to see if they are sufficient for your research - if necessary expand your question or tell the participants, the level of detail in their answers is what you need.
- Check if the questions are correctly understood - if necessary adjust your question or correct individual participants.
- Begin the analysis as soon as possible - do not wait until you have collected all the data.
- Eyeball the data to get a general impression.
- Decide on categories to organize the data. 
- Adjust categories during the process if necessary - split if too big, combine if too small.
- Clean the data from unuseful answers as you run across them.
- If you analyse in a team, work on the first 50-100 data points together, deciding on categories and classifying the answers.
- Distribute the following data amongst the team for classification - answers may match multiple categories.
- Switch the data within the team for a second blind classification and discuss possible discrepancies.
- Create frequency charts.

### Interpreting Results
First, you need to look at the frequency distribution and identify the common themes. You will get an insight on the current pain points and delights of the participants. From that you should be able to tell what you have been doing well so far in solving the problems of your target group, what you have not been doing well and where you got opportunities for future improvement. You may find the problem you need to obsess over to be slightly different than expected, ideas for additional product features or even what you thought was a problem, not being one at all. In any way, you end up with data on different experience categories and therefore many opportunities. 

### Potential Biases
- Prediction bias: Do not ask about people’s opinions on potential products, situations, what they think they need - we are bad at predicting the future! Ask about recent behaviour and problems.
- Confirmation bias: Be careful not to use leading questions or give examples for what kind of answers you expect.
