# Customer Discovery Interviews

## In Brief

Interviewing potential customers to gain insights about their perspective, pain points, purchasing habits, and so forth. Interviews also generate empathy between the customer and the entrepreneur to better aid the design and ideation process. The best interviews help narrow down the target market and provide a deep understanding of what causes a market need and the underlying psychology of the customer.

## Description

### Time Commitment and Resources

Typical rounds of customer discovery interviews require at least five separate interviews with individual customers, but some entrepreneurs advocate as many as 100 before drawing a conclusion.

Time commitment can be as little as 15 minutes per interview for consumer products to a 2 hour conversations for B2B sales.

The most significant investment of time can be in recruiting customers to interview, which can again vary from a 5 minute walk to the local coffeeshop to a lengthy cold outreach program via LinkedIn, in the case of an entrepreneur with no market access into a highly specialized vertical.

Costs are typically zero or very low. In many cases, interview subjects are offered a gift certificate for their time that can be anywhere from $5 USD to $50 USD.

### How To

#### Plan the Interview

1. Define learning goal for the interviews
2. Define key assumptions about the customer persona
3. Create a screener survey of simple questions that will identify if the potential interviewee matches your target customer persona. Here’s a nice article on screener questions from Alexander Cowan.
4. Make an interview guide \(not a write-and-strictly-follow script\). If you don’t know where to start, check out some questions from Justin Wilcox or Alexander Cowan.

_Something like this:_

* What's the hardest part about \[problem context\]?
* Can you tell me about the last time that happened?
* Why was that hard?
* What, if anything, have you done to solve that problem?
* What don't you love about the solutions you've tried?

* Prepare a handy template to put your notes in afterwards or check on the tools to record your interview \(check first legal restrictions that may apply to recordings\);

* Prepare any thank you gifts, e.g. gift cards.

#### Conduct the Interview

1. Frame -- Summarize purpose of interview with the customer.
2. Qualify -- Ask a screener question to determine if the customer is relevant to your customer persona.
3. Open -- Warm up questions, get the customer comfortable talking. 
4. Listen -- Let the customer talk and follow-up with “what” and “how” related questions.
5. Close -- Wrap up interview, ask for referrals or \(if applicable\) a follow-up interview.

#### Debrief the Interview

* Make notes promptly; sometimes video or audio recording can be a great option. 

### Interpreting Results

Are you able to listen and record data based on the following?

* **Job:** What activities are making the customer run into the problem?
* **Obstacle:** What is preventing the customer from solving their problem?
* **Goal:** If they solve their problem, then **\_**?
* **Current Solution:** How are they solving their problem?
* **Decision Trigger:** Were there pivotal moments where the customer made key decisions about a problem?
* **Interest Trigger:** Which questions did the customer express interest in?
* **Persons:** Are there any other people involved with the problem or solution?
* **Emotions:** Is there anything specific that causes the customer to express different emotions?
* **Measurement:** How is the customer measuring the cost of their problem?

### Potential Biases

* **Confirmation Bias:** The interviewer can be prompted to sell his/her vision in case the interviewee's vision differs drastically. The interviewee is tempted in his/her turn to adjust answers to the interviewer’s expectations due to personal sympathy.

* **Order Bias:** Sometimes the order in which you ask questions can affect the answers you get. So try to run questions in a different order in different interviews.
